Shriek v4

# Partitioning via consistent hashing
Starting in this version, each Shriek node will no longer be a full replica of the entire
data set. Instead, the cluster will generate a fixed-size hash ring on startup and allocate
partitions to nodes as they join and leave the cluster.

## Ring hash
On cluster startup, the initial node generates the hash ring based on the requested number
of partitions, via `create keyspace <partition count=P> <preference list size=L>`. This partition
count is of fixed size for the duration of the cluster. The hash ring is based on [Jenkins hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_hash_function), which is a 32-bit hash; as such there
can be no more than 2^32 partitions.

When a key is set in Shriek, the partition of the ring to which it is assigned is determined by the Jenkins
hash value of the key. The message with the `set` information is then routed to the correct node, and the
reply is routed back through the original recipient node to the client

## Partition preference lists
Prior to this version, every key in Shriek belonged to a single partition and
all writes were propagated to every node in the cluster. With the addition of the
ring hash, each node is responsible for a subset of the available partitions.

The initial node in the cluster is responsible for all partitions. As each node is added
to the cluster, it is assigned partitions from the ring. While there are N nodes in the cluster,
if N <= L, every node is a full replica. Once N > L, some partitions will appear some nodes and not others.


## Partition distribution

## Assumptions
- The cluster's partition count will not be adjusted after creation (this is not desired
for real world use).
