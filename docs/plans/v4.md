Shriek v4

# Partitioning via consistent hashing
Starting in this version, each Shriek node will no longer be a full replica of the entire
data set. Instead, the cluster will generate a fixed-size hash ring on startup and allocate
partitions to nodes as they join and leave the cluster.

## Ring hash
On cluster startup, the initial node generates the hash ring based on the requested number
of partitions, via `create keyspace <partition count>`. This partition count is of fixed
size for the duration of the cluster. The hash ring is based on [Jenkins hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_hash_function), which is a 32-bit hash; as such there can be no more than 2^32 partitions.

When a key is set in Shriek, the partition of the ring to which it is assigned is determined by the Jenkins
hash value of the key. The message with the `set` information is then routed to the correct node, and the
reply is routed back through the original recipient node to the client

## Partition preference lists
Prior to this stage, every key in Shriek belonged to a single partition,
and all writes were propagated to every node in the cluster,

## Partition distribution

## Assumptions
- The cluster's partition count will not be adjusted after creation (this is not desired
for real world use).
