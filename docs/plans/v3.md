Shriek v3
---
# Summary - object versioning and read-repair
Starting in this version, objects are given versions and reads are
subjected to quorum. The version of the object that is considered
"most recent" is the one that has the highest version number;
this is then replicated to all other nodes.

## Timestamp versioning (via last-write-wins Lamport stamps)
A `SET` operation may fail, and as such it is possible for Shriek nodes
to wind up with conflicting key-value pairs. Starting in v3, when a key/value
pair is written to a node, it is additionally assigned a 64-bit timestamp based
on Lamport clocks. The protocol for interacting with timestamps is as follows:
- When a key/value pair is set, it is assigned the timestamp `1`.
- Each time the key/value is read or written, its timestamp is incremented by 1
- Each time a timestamp is updated due to the read repair mechanism (described below),
its timestamp will be set to the read-repaired value. This does NOT cause an increment.

In terms of the protocol, a `SET` operation occurs to carry out normal setting behavior.
A `REPAIR` operation is a `SET` that changes the value and timestamp without the increment side effects.

## Most-recently written read repairs
In v3, no partitioning occurs and every Shriek node is a full replica. When a client
makes a `GET` request to a coordinator node, that node will query every other node
for the value of the key. When this occurs, the most recent key/value pair is selected
as the true value. Nodes that have outdated key/value pairs are sent `REPAIR`
messages to update their stale values.

If two nodes have exactly the same timestamp, both are returned to the client. The client
must then issue a `SET` to update them (although this could still leave inconsistent values
if the network is heavily partitioned). No automatic resolution of concurrent writes will occur.
