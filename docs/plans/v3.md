Shriek v3

# Object versioning and read-repair
Starting in this version, objects are given versions and reads are
subjected to quorum. The version of the object that is considered
"most recent" is the one that has the highest version number;
this is then replicated to all other nodes.

## Timestamp versioning (via last-write-wins and Unix timestamps)
When a value is written to a Shriek node, it will carry out propagation as described
in v1.1. However, starting in v1.2, the value is additionally assigned a Unix timestamp:
If a `set` operation occurs without a timestamp submitted (i.e. when the client initially
sets the value), the node's current time is used - if a `set` is executed with a timestamp
provided, it is used as the timestamp for the key.

Beyond declaring a `set` to have failed per v1.1, Shriek will not attempt to retry writes
if they fail; it is possible that nodes can wind up with stale values.

## Most-recently written read repairs
When a read occurs from a Shriek node, every node in the cluster responsible for the key (as of
this version, every node in the cluster) is queried for the value. The value that was set with
the most recent Unix timestamp is chosen to be the actual value. This value and its timestamp
are then written back to the nodes that have stale values.

If a concurrent write is observed (i.e. exactly the same timestamp for the same key but with
at least two different values), all values will persist and be sent back to the client, who
will be responsible for updating them manually. The protocol will support multiple values being
returned for a `get`.

## Assumptions
- The clocks on each node are synchronized-enough that time in our cluster
may be considered absolute.
