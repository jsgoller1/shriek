# Summary - sloppy quorum and hinted handoff
Starting in this version, a greater degree of durability is achieved by using sloppy quorum and hinted
handoff; instead

## Sloppy quorum
Starting in this version, Shriek implements a method of sloppy quorum similar to Dynamo. Reads and writes
are done against the first N healthy nodes in the cluster; if a coordinator attempts a `SET`, it will be
done against the first N healthy nodes instead of the exact nodes in the preference list as an `HHSET` instead;
if the desired combined number of `SET`s and `HHSET`s occur, the write is considered successful. Reads function
similarly with an `HHREAD` verb.

## Hinted handoff
If a coordinator cannot reach the expected nodes during sloppy quorum, it will pick a node that isn't in
the preference list for a key and send an `HHSET` message to it. If a node receives a `HHSET` for a key
that doesn't belong to it, it will store it in a secondary hashtable. Periodically, this hashtable is
checked to see if any of the keys can be sent to the proper owners - if so, they are removed from the hashtable.
