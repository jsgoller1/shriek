Shriek, v1
---
## Statement (of the problem)

Build a local key value store that supports:
- Setting a value for a key in a REPL
- Persisting that data to disk
- Retrieving the data again by key.
- Multiple local “clients” operating on the same data store.

---
## Understand / Plan
We will start with the last item first, as it impacts the rest
of the requirements. In order to support multiple "concurrent"
clients, we will implement shriek initially as a client-server
model using BSD sockets. The `man` page for `accept()` dictates
that the operating system queues pending connections to the same
port, so we should be able to support multiple clients reading/writing
to the same server (obviously they will race, but the system
will not crash when they do).

### Client
**REPL**

A REPL is a pretty simple programming construct - all we need
is a `while` loop that watches for input and exits when specific
input is given. In the REPL, we can limit ourselves to matching on the
following operations, responding with `invalid operation` for anything else:
- `get <key>`: read a key's value
- `set <key> <value>`: write a key
- `exit`: exit the REPL
As a stretch goal (only after `get` and `set` are implemented), we can also implement:
- `persist`: force shriek to write all entries to file
- `unset <key>`: remove a key
- `list`: show all keys and their values

pseudocode:
```
while(input = get_line()) {
  i = 0
  skip non-whitespace in line, i++
  replace i with \0, i++
  strcmp() input with valid options
    handle get
      remainder of input is key, client_lookup(key)
    handle set
      keyname_i = i
      skip non-whitespace in line, i++
      replace i with \0, i++
      client_install(input[keyname_i], input[i])
    handle unset
      keyname_i = i
      skip non-whitespace in line, i++
      replace i with \0, i++
      client_unset(input[keyname_i])
    handle list
      client_list()
    persist
      client_persist()
    handle exit
      break
    else
      print(invalid)
}
```

For each of the `client_*` functions, the client writes
the data to the following packet format:
```
ACTION (4 bytes)
KEY_SIZE (4 bytes)
VAL_SIZE (4 bytes)
KEY (optional, KEY_SIZE bytes)
VAL (optional, VAL_SIZE bytes)
```
The client then sends the packet to the server; if the
server replies with `OK`, this is printed.

### Server
**Setting / Retrieving data**
The server sits in loop listening for incoming connections.
When a connection is made, it fetches data from the socket
that is in the above mentioned format. It is then parsed:
```
while(input = get_line_from_socket()) {
  i = 0
  fields = atoi(input[i])
  if fields > 3
    reply with error and continue
  else
    size = parse next two bytes from i
  action = input[i+size]
  strcmp(action) with following strings:
    get
      parse remainder of input as key
      return get(key)
    set
      parse next field as key
      parse remainder as value
      set(key, value)
    unset
      parse next field as key
      invalidate(key)
    list
      walk entire table, returning each entry to client
    persist
      walk entire table, writing each entry to file.
      return
    else
      print(invalid)
}
```

The `get()` and `set()` functions handle storing and fetching the data. Data is stored in-memory in a hash
table of pointers, where keys are hashed using [Bernstein's djb2](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html).
Each pointer points to a key/value/next struct, and the list is walked when hash collisions occur.

**Persistence to disk**
Data is stored in a file on disk, in the format `<key>\0\val\n`. A function `disk_dump()` walks every entry in the table, writing it to disk.
