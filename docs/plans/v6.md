Shriek v6

# Summary - node list gossip protocol
Each node in a Shriek cluster maintains a `node list` data structure that stores
which nodes are part of the cluster (i.e their `IDs`) and how they can be
reached (their address and port). This list is updated when a new node joins the
cluster - the coordinator handling the `JOIN` operation will broadcast the new node to each
existing node. However, if this fails, the cluster needs some way of preventing every node's
node list from becoming stale. To accomplish this, v6 adds a Lamport stamp (see v3) to the nodelist;
nodes will periodically gossip to determine if their nodelist is out of sync, and if so will get the
newest possible version.
