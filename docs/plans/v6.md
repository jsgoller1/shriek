Shriek v6
---
# Summary - full backups to disk
In this version, the Shriek client will support the following commands:
- `create backup`: the client will request _every_ key in the keyspace
from every node, and write them (along with meta-data) to a backup file.
- `eval backup <path>`: the client will determine what kind of Shriek database the backup was created from (
how many nodes, how big of a partition, how many keys and values); it will print information that will allow
an administrator to create a database that will support the backup
- `import backup <path>`: the client will read the backup and attempt to restore it to the existing Shriek cluster,
or fail if this is not possible.
