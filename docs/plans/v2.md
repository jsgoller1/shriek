Shriek v2
---
## Distributed storage with O(1) routing
Each Shriek node is aware of every other node in the cluster. In this version,
every node is a full replica; the hash ring technically exists, but only has one
partition. Writes are propagated to every node in the cluster, but reads only
occur against the node queried.

### Creating a cluster
A Shriek cluster is created starting with one node; a client connects to the node
and executes `create keyspace <partition count>`. In this version, all clusters
have only one partition, and the provided count is ignored.

### Adding and removing nodes from the cluster
A Shriek node can be added to the cluster with `join <port:ip>`. The new node will connect
to the remote node at the given port/ip and announce it is joining; the remote node will add
the new node to the hash ring (in which there is only one partition, owned by every node)
and return the updated hash ring to the new node. The remote node will then inform the rest
of the cluster. The new node will then know the addresses of each other node in the cluster.

A Shriek node can only manually be removed from the cluster; if a client connects to a node
and executes `quit cluster`, the node will broadcast to every other node that it is quitting,
and then shut down.

### Reads and writes
Reads only occur against the local node; gets and sets are executed as in
v1.0 and returned to the client.

When a write occurs, it is immediately set in the local machine and at least one other
node in the cluster before the client receives an `OK`. The write is then propagated
to every other node in the node list. If no other nodes can be reached by the remote node,
the write is declared failed and the client is informed.

### Assumptions
In this version, it is assumed that:
- the partition count will not be resized after the cluster is created
- new nodes always join and exit the cluster successfully; every existing node
correctly learns about the new node, and the new node has a perfect
map of the cluster which includes itself.
